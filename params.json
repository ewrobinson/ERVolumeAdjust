{"name":"Ervolumeadjust","tagline":"This fills a gap in AVFoundation (OSX), allowing an app to control the input volume of an audio device.","body":"### ERVolumeAdjust gives you what Apple mysteriously left out of AVFoundation.\r\nThese classes work closely with AVFoundation but should play nicely with other audio frameworks. Once you get the localized name or the DeviceUID (or whatever the QTKit equivalent is - I don't feel like looking it up at the moment), you are basically done. All you have to do is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERInputVolumeControl *inputVolumeController = [[ERInputVolumeControl alloc] init];\r\n[volumeController selectInputDevice:myLocalizedOrUIDString];\r\n```\r\nThat's all it takes to load the device. Now to change the volume, you do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[volumeController setInputDeviceVolume:newVolume];//newVolume is a float between 0 and 1\r\n```\r\nThat's it! It's like magic, but without the risk of getting sorted into Hufflepuff. If you want to get the current input volume of the selected device, you do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfloat volume = [volumeController getInputDeviceVolume];//will be between 0 and 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Included is some sample code which should give you a good intro to how it all works. To use it in your project, simply copy over the ERInputVolumeControl.h/.m and ERAudioDevice.h/.m classes, and you are ready to go.\r\n\r\n###Copyright (c) <2013>, <E.
