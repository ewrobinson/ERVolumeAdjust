        <p>This fills a gap in AVFoundation (OSX), allowing an app to control the input volume of an audio device.</p>

        <h3>ERVolumeAdjust gives you what Apple mysteriously left out of AVFoundation.</h3>

<p>These classes work closely with AVFoundation but should play nicely with other audio frameworks. Once you get the localized name or the DeviceUID (or whatever the QTKit equivalent is - I don't feel like looking it up at the moment), you are basically done. All you have to do is:</p>

<pre><code>ERInputVolumeControl *inputVolumeController = [[ERInputVolumeControl alloc] init];
[volumeController selectInputDevice:myLocalizedOrUIDString];
</code></pre>

<p>That's all it takes to load the device. Now to change the volume, you do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[volumeController setInputDeviceVolume:newVolume];//newVolume is a float between 0 and 1
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! It's like magic, but without the risk of getting sorted into Hufflepuff. If you want to get the current input volume of the selected device, you do this:</p>

<pre><code>float volume = [volumeController getInputDeviceVolume];//will be between 0 and 1.
</code></pre>

<h3>Included is some sample code which should give you a good intro to how it all works. To use it in your project, simply copy over the ERInputVolumeControl.h/.m and ERAudioDevice.h/.m classes, and you are ready to go.</h3>
